        <h1>Week 3</h1>

<p>So I am pretty evenly divided into abstract random/abstract sequential thinking. Concrete thinking isn&#39;t really my style and never has been. I tend to believe there&#39;s always more to something than meets the eye. I don&#39;t deal with black and white very well-- I just don&#39;t think life works that way. I am more comfortable in dealing with shades of gray. As for my ordering ability, I can do sequential or random pretty consistently, and I feel like they both have their own pros and cons in different situations. Sometimes it&#39;s easier for me to start with what I know, for example and then figure out things around that. Sometimes I can&#39;t deal unless I can start from the very beginning.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already found ways that I can use this knowledge to my advantage in my learning at DBC. For example, when working with HTML and CSS, I use a very sequential way of approaching code. I like to have my descriptors ordered the same way in different elements. However, when it has come to JavaScript, I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s easier for me to start from a place of &quot;how is this like something I already know?&quot; (usually Ruby), and then move from there (i.e. saying what&#39;s the same and different from Ruby in the syntax). I look for what I recognize and then use that as a starting point, regardless of wherever that is in the &quot;linear&quot; process. </p>

<p>I also agree with the idea that I work best alone as long as I can ask for help when I need it. I learn best when I can process something through on my own, but I don&#39;t like feeling helpless when I know I need help. Guidelines are helpful to me in the sense that I know I can only think outside the box unless I have the box to begin with. Otherwise I can go off on too many tangents. I need some basic structure to start with. </p>

<p>Phase 0 isn&#39;t so bad for me-- I can work through things on my own, at my own pace and in whatever order I find useful, get through things I know quickly and then focus on what I don&#39;t-- when I have time. Time is my biggest challenge-- not that I can&#39;t manage it, just that I don&#39;t have enough of it.</p>

<p>I have been forced to have a growth mindset when it comes to learning for a long time. I went to a high school where it was incredibly common for me to go from being the smartest person in one class to the weakest in another-- we&#39;re talking students who were in 12th grade classes in eighth grade genius kids. Also as an actor, I&#39;ve never encountered a role or other actor I&#39;ve worked with that I didn&#39;t learn something from. As long as you&#39;re not patronizing (my pet peeve), I&#39;m really open to criticism. We wouldn&#39;t be going to DBC if we were already excellent coders. I think we&#39;re all open to learning here. I know that I&#39;ve probably got stronger soft skills than some people, and I hope I can contribute to others&#39; learning in that way. I&#39;ve already learned a lot from my peers on the code side. As long as we&#39;re not set against each other, in which case I fear a recreation of the Hunger Games, I&#39;m sure this is going to be a great learning experience for all of us.</p>
