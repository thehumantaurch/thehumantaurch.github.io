        <h1>Week 8</h1>

<h2>Conflicting Feelings</h2>

<p>Dealing with conflict has never been a strong suit of mine. I didn&#39;t grow up in a house that ever dealt with it in a remotely healthy manner. I was taught to hold in all my feelings so as not to make things worse. This habit is such an innate part of me that I&#39;m having trouble remembering the last time I dealt with conflict. To that end, on the compass of shame I am mainly a massochist and runner.</p>

<p>About two years ago my parents (well, my father) suggested that I apply to business school. It was a good natured and well intentioned suggestion. I was &quot;too smart&quot; to be doing what I was doing. My father went to business school and my mother minored in business. It shouldn&#39;t have been a problem, except of course as my best friend so eloquently put it:</p>

<p><i>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, have your parents met you?!&quot;</i></p>

<p>They could have told me to go to law school and I would have said it was pedestrian and obvious and had a million reasons why I shouldn&#39;t go that they would have believed. If they had told me to go to med school, I would say that I wish I could, but my pathologic fear of getting my blood drawn was probably prohibitive. But business school? Wherever I was on the career/mentality/aptitude/personality spectrums (spectra?), business school was at the opposite end. </p>

<p>I tried to laugh it off. My father persisted. I made excuses (suddenly math REALLY wasn&#39;t my thing as opposed to me just preferring languages). My father persisted. There was a good 15 (though probably closer to 20) minute discussion in front of both of my brothers, neither of whom would comment on whether or not they thought business school was a good idea for me (one had just gotten into business school, so he was biased anyway). I eventually turned to my mother and she placidly said that I could do anything I put my mind to. Shocked, and completely taken aback, I wouldn&#39;t let any of them leave the room until the application was completed and done. I blasted through it in about an hour and a half. </p>

<p>The conflict obviously had nothing to do with whether or not I could do business school, or even whether or not I should have gone to business school. It was about feeling betrayed, in particular, by my mother. As I was insisting that business school and I would not be a good mix, no one supported me. </p>

<p>So I acceded. I filled out the application. Until a few days later when I finally blew up at my mother, and by &quot;blew up&quot; I mean &quot;break down in front of&quot; and asked why she thought I would be a good fit at business school because I truly and honestly couldn&#39;t see it for myself. Everyone thought it was a good idea but me, so I was just begging someone to help me see it. My mother&#39;s response? She didn&#39;t honestly think it was a great idea, but it was AN idea and I filled out the application so quickly she figured I must have somehow gotten excited by the idea of going back to school. It was then that I finally got angry. She said if I didn&#39;t want to do it, I needed to learn to say so. </p>

<p>Ouch. And as is so often the case, it hurt because it was true. It was undoubtedly a wake-up call, and I&#39;ve since been more aware of acquiescing simply to keep the peace or putting up with something because it&#39;s &quot;easier&quot; than dealing with the problem. What struck me most, however, was how it took me 3 days or so to articulate the feelings the conflict had stirred in me. I&#39;ve grown up suppressing and delaying how I process those feelings for over 20 years, and it&#39;s a hard habit to break. The awareness at least is a start, and hopefully I can continue to get better.</p>
