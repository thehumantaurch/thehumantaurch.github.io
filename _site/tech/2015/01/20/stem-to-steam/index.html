  <h2 id="or-the-value-of-an-artistic-background-in-tech">Or: The Value of an Artistic Background in Tech</h2>

<p>There’s been some talk recently of trying to go from talking about STEM to talking about STEAM. As someone who has gone from the “A” to the “T”, it unfortunately rings true that a lot of the skills I’ve learned from working in the arts, skills so deeply ingrained in me that I don’t even think of them as skills anymore, aren’t widely present in the tech world. Why should you hire an artist? Here are a few reasons:</p>

<h3 id="working-together">Working Together</h3>

<p>Sure, you can learn teamwork through being on a sports team, but there’s a certain sense of dependency in the arts that you don’t necessarily get on a sports team. You can’t always pass it off to that one guy or girl who could almost always score. And no one could accuse you of not contributing as much if you were playing defense. In an orchestra, every instrument matters equally. If you don’t do your job, and everyone around you doesn’t do their job, things fall apart. </p>

<h3 id="working-solo">Working Solo</h3>

<p>That being said, artists can work alone and have to know how to work alone, too. You can’t audition as a group. Your skills are your own. But this ties back into the working as a team: if you don’t know and practice your part, the group can’t succeed. Another actor in the cast cannot learn your lines and do your part. When working in the arts, when given a job you enter into a contract, written or unwritten, that you trust everyone else to do their job, and everyone trusts you to do yours.</p>

<h3 id="constant-learning">Constant Learning</h3>

<p>You think you know it all? An artist generally won’t get too far with that kind of attitude. Every new person you work with is a chance to learn in the arts. Kevin Spacey, who’s won ALL the awards, wouldn’t go into a working on a scene with Dame Judi Dench, who has won more than ALL the awards, and think he had nothing to gain from working with her. Every project presents its own new challenges, and a chance to find a new weakness. Which leads us to …</p>

<h3 id="comfort-with-uncertainty">Comfort with Uncertainty</h3>
<p>No matter how successful an artist becomes, they’re unlikely to forget the hard times. Those times when they weren’t sure where they were getting their next paycheck and whether or not they could make rent. Uncertainty is a huge part of life for an artist. They’ve waited to hear about auditions and never gotten a response. They’ve gotten their 6 AM call time at 12:30 AM and changed their schedule to accomodate it. They’ve been bumped up to first string at the last minute and felt they had the world riding on their shoulders. They know how to deal with stress.</p>

<h3 id="comfort-with-sudden-changes">Comfort with Sudden Changes</h3>
<p>Artists generally aren’t at the top of the totem pole. They’re usually the low man. They can have opinions and feelings, but they usually don’t get to have much say or agency in how something is done. They’re usually the last person to find something out that specifically deals with them. They’ve accepted this. They’re used to it. When you change the lines on opening night, they shut up and learn them.</p>

<h3 id="they-know-the-show-must-go-on">They Know the Show Must Go On</h3>
<p>If nothing else, an artist knows not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. If you get sick on opening night, you probably have to suck it up. If you really can’t, everyone else helps your understudy get through. They’re problem solvers. When a prop breaks onstage, they improvise. </p>

<p>This isn’t to say that artists don’t whine, that they don’t have diva moments or don’t crumble under pressure.  But when deployment is about to happen and a new bug is found, just know that an artist has probably been in that situation before. They’ll feel the pressure, but they’ll flow with it. They might not come up with the best solution, but it’ll work for the time being. They’ll talk with the team, but take it upon themselves to make sure a solution is found. So thank your lucky stars when you meet an artist who wants to work for you. They’re used to overcoming adversity, and they’ll be sure to do it for you.</p>
