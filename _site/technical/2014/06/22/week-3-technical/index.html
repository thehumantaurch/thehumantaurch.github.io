<p>JavaScript is one of the older web programming languages, but still one of the most widely used. It was started at Netscape, a company that wanted to be able to compete with Microsoft. They needed a user-friendly scripting language of their own since they couldn’t use Microsoft’s Visual Basic (a light and easy language), and thus JavaScript was born. It wasn’t that long before Microsoft began to support JavaScript. Initially it was considered somewhat unprofessional, but now it has expanded to many libraries and platforms. Because it’s so adaptable, it can be used for more and more things as technology develops.</p>

<p>JavaScript enables the interaction of the DOM locally, and therefore very quickly. It can take and process user input incredibly fast! That’s why JavaScript is often used in games and the interactive parts of websites. If HTML and CSS make up what you see in a website, JavaScript makes up what the website does. Sort of like Microsoft Word is a program, a piece of software, that you use on your computer, JavaScript is what makes up those programs on a website. It can be used to manipulate all sorts of things and is very flexible– it’s simple to code, so it’s easy to adapt and change the JavaScript as necessary (and adaptability is important in our ever-changing technology environment). It’s widely supported– on all browsers and devices. It was designed specifically to work across all browsers and devices way back in the day. You can even use JavaScript offline.</p>

<p>However, JavaScript was released into the wild before it was “finished”. It can get buggy very easily. If you tell JavaScript that x=1, and you set JavaScript to put out k+1, you get 11 instead of 2. While adding things together like that instead of mathematical addition can be useful, you can also see where it would seriously complicate things. Issues like that plague JavaScript still to this day. The flexibility also makes things very messy. To be specific, code gets very long and repetitive. Then again, there wouldn’t be the web today as we know it without JavaScript, so it’s better to focus on the positives and all the things JavaScript can do for us.</p>
