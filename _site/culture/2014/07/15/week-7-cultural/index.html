  <li>Coolness under fire</li>
  <li>Friendships</li>

  <li>Helping others</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="release-2-on-tenacity">Release 2: On Tenacity</h2>
<p>My friends tell me I am one of the most perseverant people they’ve ever met and will likely ever meet, and this is one of the highest compliments I feel I can be given. To this point in my life, I don’t have a lot that’s tangible proof of that, but it’s definitely defined who I am. I’ve been told “no” a lot in my life. To me, there is little more admirable than determination. One of my favorite lines from any movie is from Batman Begins: Why do we fall, Bruce? So we can learn to pick ourselves back up. It’s a skill that can’t be taught, and, more importantly, can’t be learned unless you’re willing to fall down a lot. I respect anyone who’s got that skill for that reason.</p>

<h2 id="release-4-valuable-advice">Release 4: Valuable Advice</h2>
<p>The last time someone asked me for advice, it was about family troubles. They asked because I’ve had more than my fair share of experience with family drama. I have to say that I’m not even sure that my answers were that helpful, but it was more important for the person to hear that I understood what she was going through and she wasn’t the only child who’d ever had to go through it.</p>

<h2 id="release-5-values-and-stereotype-threat">Release 5: Values and Stereotype Threat</h2>
<p>Values are what define a person. They may not be the values you want, but your values define you. I was pleasantly surprised when I thought about what my values really were, as opposed to what I thought or said they were, and they lined up pretty well. I know that I can use my self respect, helping others, and coolness under fire when dealing with stereotype threat when it comes from others (provided I notice it and don’t brush it off, which I think may be a bigger challenge). When I see it in myself, I will have to use my tenacity– a sort of self discipline to face my (temporary) failures and improve myself in the future.</p>

<p>When I’m down at DBC (which will happen– I know I’ll get stressed, or frustrated, or overwhelmed), I have to remember to above all take care of myself. Eating right, exercising, sleeping– these are the first things to go. Which is fine, but I find that I can usually get back to being me by starting with taking care of myself. I also won’t let myself be alone. I’m going to be away from my friends, but I’ll make new friends and will call on those nearby. Most of all, I’m not going to beat myself up. There’s that tenacity again :)</p>
