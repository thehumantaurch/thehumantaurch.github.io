  <h1 id="week-1">Week 1</h1>

<p>One of the reasons I chose Dev Bootcamp was because I got the sense that I was going to be learning a lot more than code. When I was researching online I kept feeling as though DBC looked at the student as a whole person rather than just a student. I felt like maybe even though I wasn’t going to be the best coder coming in, I’d be in really good hands, and, important to me, that there were skills that I could contribute (life-skills) that others might struggle with. The video didn’t disuade me from this idea.</p>

<p>I have often found myself surrounded by extremely talented people, both as a student and as an actor. When you work with people who are more talented than you it forces you to rise to their level as much as you can. It’s overwhelming at times, but if you’re giving it your all I’ve found that most people respond with encouragement and patience. On the other hand, I’ve been the “more talented” person as well. As long as people work hard, things usually work out for the best. It seems to me that DBC very much values this mentality, so it’s somewhat comforting because I already understand it. Though I am admittedly still intimidated, I keep trying to remind myself of that when I get discouraged or overwhelmed.</p>

<p>I guess my biggest worry is that I won’t be able to contribute as much as I hope to. When I get impatient with myself, I start to get impatient with others as well, and though I’m trying to be mindful of that, I’m not sure I’ll always manage to keep my cool. I think also the anticipation just makes it all the more nervewracking. The closer we get to Aug 4, the more nervous I’ll be, but after Aug 4 I’ll be so busy I won’t have time to be nervous!</p>
