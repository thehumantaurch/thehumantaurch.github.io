        <h1>Week 7: Value Added</h1>

<h2>Release 1: Values I Value</h2>

<ul>
<li>Coolness under fire</li>
<li>Friendships</li>
<li>Creativity</li>
<li>Enthusiasm</li>
<li>Helping others</li>
<li>Tenacity</li>
<li>Adventure</li>
<li>Freedom</li>
<li>Inspiration</li>
<li>Self-respect</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 2: On Tenacity</h2>

<p>My friends tell me I am one of the most perseverant people they&#39;ve ever met and will likely ever meet, and this is one of the highest compliments I feel I can be given. To this point in my life, I don&#39;t have a lot that&#39;s tangible proof of that, but it&#39;s definitely defined who I am. I&#39;ve been told &quot;no&quot; a lot in my life. To me, there is little more admirable than determination. One of my favorite lines from any movie is from Batman Begins: Why do we fall, Bruce? So we can learn to pick ourselves back up. It&#39;s a skill that can&#39;t be taught, and, more importantly, can&#39;t be learned unless you&#39;re willing to fall down a lot. I respect anyone who&#39;s got that skill for that reason.</p>

<h2>Release 4: Valuable Advice</h2>

<p>The last time someone asked me for advice, it was about family troubles. They asked because I&#39;ve had more than my fair share of experience with family drama. I have to say that I&#39;m not even sure that my answers were that helpful, but it was more important for the person to hear that I understood what she was going through and she wasn&#39;t the only child who&#39;d ever had to go through it.</p>

<h2>Release 5: Values and Stereotype Threat</h2>

<p>Values are what define a person. They may not be the values you want, but your values define you. I was pleasantly surprised when I thought about what my values really were, as opposed to what I thought or said they were, and they lined up pretty well. I know that I can use my self respect, helping others, and coolness under fire when dealing with stereotype threat when it comes from others (provided I notice it and don&#39;t brush it off, which I think may be a bigger challenge). When I see it in myself, I will have to use my tenacity-- a sort of self discipline to face my (temporary) failures and improve myself in the future.</p>

<p>When I&#39;m down at DBC (which will happen-- I know I&#39;ll get stressed, or frustrated, or overwhelmed), I have to remember to above all take care of myself. Eating right, exercising, sleeping-- these are the first things to go. Which is fine, but I find that I can usually get back to being me by starting with taking care of myself. I also won&#39;t let myself be alone. I&#39;m going to be away from my friends, but I&#39;ll make new friends and will call on those nearby. Most of all, I&#39;m not going to beat myself up. There&#39;s that tenacity again :)</p>
