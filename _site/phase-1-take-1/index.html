        <h1>The Post Month 1 Recap</h1>
        <h2></h2>

        <h2>When Last We Met Our Hero...</h2>

<p>It was week 1 of phase 1 of Dev Bootcamp! After 9 weeks of grueling self-study she was finally in New York City studying in person. Spirits were high!</p>

<h1>The Pledge</h1>

<p>Things were cool back in week 1, before we got into object-oriented design, before databases and Active Record. Things were hard, and they got harder, but at some point (maybe on Sudoku day, maybe on Active Record Jr. day), I started to withdraw. For whatever reason (and I have a few theories) my confidence plummeted, and I started acting as if everything was okay when it really wasn&#39;t. This, of course, turned into a vicious cycle of lower confidence, more withdrawal, and less learning. DBC makes a point of wanting you to constantly be uncomfortable, but also acknowledge if that discomfort turns to drowning. I was drowning, but I didn&#39;t ask for help.</p>

<p>You can probably see where this is going. A week ago today I sat down after yoga to take my final assessment for phase 1, and it did not go well. It could partially have been a self-fulfilling prophecy, my own gender discrimination (yes, I&#39;m sexist, too), that I really wasn&#39;t feeling well, that I panicked, or maybe a combination of all of the above, but whatever it was: I choked. And while I knew the material, I didn&#39;t really KNOW the material. I hadn&#39;t owned it, yet. </p>

<h1>The Turn</h1>

<p>The Bad News: I failed. </p>

<p>DBC doesn&#39;t call it that, of course, but it still felt like it. I was asked to repeat phase 1. Friday was terrible, and Monday might have been worse (seeing your friends go on to new material and you&#39;re with brand new people who all know each other starting back at &quot;GO&quot; and not having collected $200). I said I&#39;d be okay with it, and when it came down to it, I realized there was no way I could have really prepared myself to be okay with it. </p>

<h1>The Prestige</h1>

<p>I learned more about myself in the weekend between Phase 1, Take 1 and Phase 1, Take 2 and the past few days than I have in awhile. I learned how hard it is for me to advocate for myself. I learned that there were some people in my cohort(class) that were really intimidating me, and that was hard to admit. I learned that I had started doubting myself even before things got rough, and I hadn&#39;t even noticed. </p>

<p>I also learned how to ask for and accept help. I also learned that I knew the material better than I thought, but I wasn&#39;t breaking problems down enough. I also learned what I didn&#39;t learn in the first three weeks, and I&#39;m working on remedying that now. </p>

<p>My new cohort is a much better environment for me, and my teachers are answering my questions (mostly because I&#39;m actually asking them). The feedback I gave to the school has really been implemented. This is all the Good News. </p>

<h1>The Other Bad News</h1>

<p>Yeah, you guessed it-- I won&#39;t be back on October 4 anymore :( . Not only that, I won&#39;t be back in time to do the dance workshop I signed up for with Sonya Tayeh. And also... there was a haircut... that went about 2 inches shorter than expected... it&#39;s shoulder length. It was(still is) traumatic. </p>

<p>BUT things are way better this time around. I&#39;m learning a lot more, and getting a lot more help, and working with people who are as a group more awesome than the group I was in last time. I&#39;ve realized that more than anything I get intimidated even when I know the material, and that intimidation is paralyzing. It&#39;s hard to overcome, but I&#39;m working on it. Also, I get to see more friends in NYC now :) </p>
