        <h1>Week 1</h1>

<p>One of the reasons I chose Dev Bootcamp was because I got the sense that I was going to be learning a lot more than code. When I was researching online I kept feeling as though DBC looked at the student as a whole person rather than just a student. I felt like maybe even though I wasn&#39;t going to be the best coder coming in, I&#39;d be in really good hands, and, important to me, that there were skills that I could contribute (life-skills) that others might struggle with. The video didn&#39;t disuade me from this idea.</p>

<p>I have often found myself surrounded by extremely talented people, both as a student and as an actor. When you work with people who are more talented than you it forces you to rise to their level as much as you can. It&#39;s overwhelming at times, but if you&#39;re giving it your all I&#39;ve found that most people respond with encouragement and patience. On the other hand, I&#39;ve been the &quot;more talented&quot; person as well. As long as people work hard, things usually work out for the best. It seems to me that DBC very much values this mentality, so it&#39;s somewhat comforting because I already understand it. Though I am admittedly still intimidated, I keep trying to remind myself of that when I get discouraged or overwhelmed.</p>

<p>I guess my biggest worry is that I won&#39;t be able to contribute as much as I hope to. When I get impatient with myself, I start to get impatient with others as well, and though I&#39;m trying to be mindful of that, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll always manage to keep my cool. I think also the anticipation just makes it all the more nervewracking. The closer we get to Aug 4, the more nervous I&#39;ll be, but after Aug 4 I&#39;ll be so busy I won&#39;t have time to be nervous!</p>
