<h2>The Perils and Positives of Pairing</h2>

<p>Ah, pairing... we love it and we hate it. Or maybe I&#39;m using the royal &quot;we&quot;. Pairing often can feel like a first date. You&#39;re nervous. You don&#39;t know if the person will like you. You don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll click. And sometimes you do. Sometimes you don&#39;t, and that hour seems to drag on interminably.</p>

<p>Pairing is sort of a double-edged sword. I enjoy it because I always solve problems faster when in a pair, and usually learn a great deal from my partner. However, it puts me in a position of vulnerability nine times out of ten as I&#39;m rarely confident with the material. It&#39;s frustrating to feel like I&#39;m not contributing an equal amount, and I often beat myself up about that. Then again, if I learn the most from pairing, the more I pair, the more I will learn. Thus: double-edged sword.</p>

<p>It&#39;s incredibly rewarding to work with someone who&#39;s sort of on the same level as me. Problem solving together with someone who communicates well with you is a joy. You learn and contribute! It gives me confidence when I know I&#39;m contributing. However, I have to put myself in a position where I&#39;m not confident, and potentially will only end up frustrated in my lack of knowledge and skills.</p>

<p>I&#39;m my own worst enemy, or rather my own worst critic. I know what I don&#39;t know, and just because I do my best to learn doesn&#39;t mean I know everything I should/want to know at this point. The feedback I receive from others is usually something I already know and have thought. The hardest thing for me to read is when a piece of feedback says I wasn&#39;t always motivating or inspiring. I know I&#39;m not going to necessarily benefit someone technically, so I want that to be my contribution.</p>

<p>I know I need to also work a little bit on my communication. My mind works faster than my mouth can, but my brain doesn&#39;t necessarily solidify thoughts unless I manifest them in words or code or writing, etc. I know this can be frustrating for people I work with sometimes-- it&#39;s frustrating for me, too! I don&#39;t want to monopolize a session by talking just so I can solidify my understanding either. </p>

<p>I know we haven&#39;t gotten to anything to frustrating for everyone yet, but it&#39;s very hard to be constructive with feedback sometimes-- especially as I&#39;m usually the one with the smaller knowledge base on the concept we&#39;re working on. I also feel like our cohort is reluctant to give constructive feedback. The one time I really thought I had written a piece of constructive feedback, I don&#39;t think my pair ever saw it because it wasn&#39;t considered kind, though I struggled to make it constructive AND kind a great deal while writing it. We can&#39;t improve without constructive feedback! It&#39;s not mean, we&#39;re just trying to be helpful. I have to take constructive criticism on a daily basis, so I&#39;m used to it. I even enjoy it. And, despite the first date-esque nature of some pairing, it&#39;s really the only way I&#39;m going to learn.</p>
