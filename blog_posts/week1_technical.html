				<h2>Week 2</h2>
			<p>
				Let's be honest: at first glance "class"es and "id"s seem to be pretty much the same thing. But if we're being honest (and we are) there is no way that programmers who live for ease and efficiency would interchangeably use two completely different tags. So... what is the difference? </p>
			<p>
				In general, IDs are going to be more specific. IDs will outrank other HTML elements and classes. There are many analogies I've come across. Each student can only have his or her own ID, but a bunch of them can be in the same class. Or the difference between a barcode and a serial number-- all White 32GB iPhone 5s for Verizon will have the same barcode. That's all the store needs to know when you're purchasing it so it knows how much to charge you. But each of those iPhones also has its own unique serial number, which indicates which iPhone belongs to you and only you. </p>
			<p>
				So what? They still do the same things, right? While this isn't necessarily going to affect your coding between CSS and HTML, the difference is more important when it comes to interacting with the DOM or other languages such as JavaScript. An ID acts like a "you are here" sticker for JavaScript. You don't want to have more than one "you are here". You can't be in more than one place at once. A class won't interact the same way, so you can have them wherever.</p>
			<p>
				An important (nay, one might even say crucial) thing to remember is when naming classes is that they should be named specifically but not descriptively. For example, if you name a class "red_text" and then have to change your color scheme, you would have to go into your HTML and change every instance of the class-- well, you wouldn't HAVE to. You could just change the colors in the CSS, but it could get confusing to anyone else looking at your code. Try to name classes according to their function. Instead of "red_text", you could say "warning_text". 
			</p> 
			<p>
				So really, there are two things to as yourself when it comes to IDs and classes: </p>
			<p>
				1. Is what I'm about to create completely unique? Will it always be unique in the future? If yes, it should be an ID. If not, a class. </p>
			<p>
				And then: </p>
			<p>
				2. How do I name this according to function as opposed to description? </p>

			<h2>Week 1</h2>
			<p><h3>Facebook</h3></p>
		<p>
			This is one of my favorite sites because I use it very often. I also wanted to analyze it because it occurred to me that it's not actually very well designed. Your eye is drawn to whatever is at the top of your newsfeed, which is good, but then there's either a lot of blank space or a lot of clutter on either side. Though this could have something to do with how I've customzied how it appears.
		</p>
		<p>
			Visually I would describe the website as bright, crowded, content-heavy, simple, and cluttered. It's a site to facilitate connections between people via messaging and newsfeed updates, so it's supposed to do many things. That's where it gets into trouble I think, since it's trying to do them all. For the purpose of the site I'd say it's fun and serious, user driven, complex, and all encompassing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fortunately, Facebook is very navigable-- but then again there are so many links that's why it starts to feel cluttered. You could never browse through all the content of Facebook, but either I've gotten good at it, or it's fairly user friendly. I find I'm sort of indifferent to my time spent on Facebook. It's become a part of my every day life, but I don't love it or hate it per se. It doesn't make me feel much of anything, except I like to be able to catch up on the "news" from my friends and co-workers.
		</p>
		<h3>Fitness Blender</h3>
		<p>
			Fitness Blender is a great resource for all kind of workout and nutrition information. It's actually like having a trainer work out with you. Your eye is first drawn to the "Find a Workout" section becasue of the bright color in contrast to the mostly black and white website. That is the link to the content, so that's good! Visually the site is simple, engaging, efficient, clean, and inviting.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fitness Blender is designed to help people workout at home. It has instructional videos and meal plans to help people become more healthy. The content is practical, fun, engaging, straightforward, and motivational. The design seems to support this content given the adjectives I chose. I've found the site to be very user friendly-- it's never cluttered, and the drop down search menu with all the options makes it easy to customize and re-customize the kind of workout your'e looking for.
		</p>
		<p>
			After being on the site for awhile I feel motivated to get moving! The site does sell things, and I have bought a few ebooks from them. The couple that runs this site can't afford to do it full time, but they still provide so many resources so when they offered a sale, I felt good about giving them money.
		</p>
		<h3>Kotaku</h3>
		<p>
			I'm a huge nerd, and Kotaku compiles a lot of news from the movie world, anime world, video game world, sci-fi/fantasy world, etc and puts it all in one place for me. My eye isn't really drawn to anything on the homepage, unless there's a huge picture at the top of the newsfeed, no matter how close I am. I suppose that's the most important area of the site. Visually the site is very simple, plain, basic, cluttered, but clean. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The website provides news. The content is a whole range of news stories with attached pictures and videos. The site is fun, a bit silly, nerd-tastic, comprehensive, and informative. Those adjectives don't really match up all that much to the visual adjectives. The homepage is somewhat annoying there are headlines on the left that are the same as the slightly expanded headlines and snippets of news you get on the right. To find articles on a certain topic or by a certain author requires searching.
		</p>
		<p>
			The problem with browsing through the site is that you have to keep scrolling down to the bottom of the page, and then click to go to the next page, and so on. It's hard to keep track of where you left off in the news cycle. I do rely on the site, but it does get frustrating to not be able to find the stories I'm most interested in other than by searching or scrolling.
