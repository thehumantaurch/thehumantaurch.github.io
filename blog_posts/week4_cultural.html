        While the issue of women in tech has already been addressed by others, I'd like to take a bit of a different approach on it. Tech is not the only field in which there's under representation. I work in another field in which this is a chronic issue: the arts. The artistic world is known for being incredibly liberal, and yet we still have a problem. Males dominate writer positions, director positions, and there are fewer roles for women even though there are more women than men who want to be in the field. </p>

        Since most of the readers for this blog will be in this program and the majority of students are men, I'm going to try to explain the female perspective for you and what you can do to help. I was working with a director (male), on a Shakespearean (male) play, with another actor (male). That's fine. We were working on a scene and all trying to wrestle with how to make it work with the characters we had developed. I made one suggestion. Neither my scene partner or my director seemed to think it would work, which, again, is fine. However, about five minutes later, my scene partner made the same suggestion, and we went with it. These men, whom I adore working with and respect, are not insensitive. The director, in fact, changed many of the roles in the show from men to women because he believes that women need more of a voice in theater.</p>

        Soraya Chemaly, who writes for Huffington Post and Salon among others, addressed this phenomenon in this piece: <a href= "http://www.alternet.org/words-every-woman-should-know?paging=off&current_page=1#bookmark">The Words Every Woman Should Know".</a> The basic jist of the piece is that men still hold a certain sense of privilege. I later pointed out what happened to both my director and fellow actor, and they were horrified. They truly hadn't realized what they had done. They apologized profusely. They've since been more aware about what listening to each and every contribution made by anyone, regardless of gender. </p>
      <p>
        It's that awareness that's necessary. In the aftermath of the shootings by Elliot Rodger in Santa Barbara, #yesallwomen (to review, Time made it easy for you: <a href="http://time.com/114043/yesallwomen-hashtag-santa-barbara-shooting/">The Most Powerful #YesAllWomen Tweets</a>) took social media by storm. The counterattack was that #notallmen do terrible things to women. Of course not. The point was to make men aware of certain aspects of the female experience. If we can continue to encourage men to be aware of their privilege, which, unfortunately, will require constant vigilance as it is so deeply ingrained, we can change the balance of men and women in the tech industry.</p>
      <p>
        That's not to say that women don't have a role as well. We have to try to combat <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/04/the-confidence-gap/359815/">The Confidence Gap</a> among other things. We need to make sure we're heard, and we also need to give those gentle reminders about awareness when necessary. If men and women work together on this awareness, we can change the ratio between them in tech. </p>

        (Okay, and let's be honest, we also need to stop doing stuff like: <a href="http://www.polygon.com/e3-2014/2014/6/10/5798592/assassins-creed-unity-female-assassins">THIS</a>.)</p>
