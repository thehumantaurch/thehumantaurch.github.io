				JavaScript enables the interaction of the DOM locally, and therefore very quickly. It can take and process user input incredibly fast! That's why JavaScript is often used in games and the interactive parts of websites. It can be used to manipulate all sorts of things and is very flexible-- it's simple to code, so it's easy to adapt and change the JavaScript as necessary (and adaptability is important in our ever-changing technology environment). It's widely supported-- on all browsers and devices. It was designed specifically to work across all browsers and devices way back in the day.You can even use JavaScript offline.</p>

				However, JavaScript was released into the wild before it was "finished". It can get buggy very easily.</p>
