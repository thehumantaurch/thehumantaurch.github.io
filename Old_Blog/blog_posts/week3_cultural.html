        So I am pretty evenly divided into abstract random/abstract sequential thinking. Concrete thinking isn't really my style and never has been. I tend to believe there's always more to something than meets the eye. I don't deal with black and white very well-- I just don't think life works that way. I am more comfortable in dealing with shades of gray. As for my ordering ability, I can do sequential or random pretty consistently, and I feel like they both have their own pros and cons in different situations. Sometimes it's easier for me to start with what I know, for example and then figure out things around that. Sometimes I can't deal unless I can start from the very beginning. </p>

        I've already found ways that I can use this knowledge to my advantage in my learning at DBC. For example, when working with HTML and CSS, I use a very sequential way of approaching code. I like to have my descriptors ordered the same way in different elements. However, when it has come to JavaScript, I've found that it's easier for me to start from a place of "how is this like something I already know?" (usually Ruby), and then move from there (i.e. saying what's the same and different from Ruby in the syntax). I look for what I recognize and then use that as a starting point, regardless of wherever that is in the "linear" process. </p>
      <p>
        I also agree with the idea that I work best alone as long as I can ask for help when I need it. I learn best when I can process something through on my own, but I don't like feeling helpless when I know I need help. Guidelines are helpful to me in the sense that I know I can only think outside the box unless I have the box to begin with. Otherwise I can go off on too many tangents. I need some basic structure to start with. </p>
      <p>
        Phase 0 isn't so bad for me-- I can work through things on my own, at my own pace and in whatever order I find useful, get through things I know quickly and then focus on what I don't-- when I have time. Time is my biggest challenge-- not that I can't manage it, just that I don't have enough of it.</p>
      <p>
        I have been forced to have a growth mindset when it comes to learning for a long time. I went to a high school where it was incredibly common for me to go from being the smartest person in one class to the weakest in another-- we're talking students who were in 12th grade classes in eighth grade genius kids. Also as an actor, I've never encountered a role or other actor I've worked with that I didn't learn something from. As long as you're not patronizing (my pet peeve), I'm really open to criticism. We wouldn't be going to DBC if we were already excellent coders. I think we're all open to learning here. I know that I've probably got stronger soft skills than some people, and I hope I can contribute to others' learning in that way. I've already learned a lot from my peers on the code side. As long as we're not set against each other, in which case I fear a recreation of the Hunger Games, I'm sure this is going to be a great learning experience for all of us.</p>
