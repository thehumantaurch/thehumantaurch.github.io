Conflicting Feelings
--------------------

Dealing with conflict has never been a strong suit of mine. I didn't grow up in a house that ever dealt with it in a remotely healthy manner. I was taught to hold in all my feelings so as not to make things worse. This habit is such an innate part of me that I'm having trouble remembering the last time I dealt with conflict. To that end, on the compass of shame I am mainly a massochist and runner.

About two years ago my parents (well, my father) suggested that I apply to business school. It was a good natured and well intentioned suggestion. I was "too smart" to be doing what I was doing. My father went to business school and my mother minored in business. It shouldn't have been a problem, except of course as my best friend so eloquently put it:

<i>"I'm sorry, have your parents met you?!"</i>

They could have told me to go to law school and I would have said it was pedestrian and obvious and had a million reasons why I shouldn't go that they would have believed. If they had told me to go to med school, I would say that I wish I could, but my pathologic fear of getting my blood drawn was probably prohibitive. But business school? Wherever I was on the career/mentality/aptitude/personality spectrums (spectra?), business school was at the opposite end. 

I tried to laugh it off. My father persisted. I made excuses (suddenly math REALLY wasn't my thing as opposed to me just preferring languages). My father persisted. There was a good 15 (though probably closer to 20) minute discussion in front of both of my brothers, neither of whom would comment on whether or not they thought business school was a good idea for me (one had just gotten into business school, so he was biased anyway). I eventually turned to my mother and she placidly said that I could do anything I put my mind to. Shocked, and completely taken aback, I wouldn't let any of them leave the room until the application was completed and done. I blasted through it in about an hour and a half. 

The conflict obviously had nothing to do with whether or not I could do business school, or even whether or not I should have gone to business school. It was about feeling betrayed, in particular, by my mother. As I was insisting that business school and I would not be a good mix, no one supported me. 

So I acceded. I filled out the application. Until a few days later when I finally blew up at my mother, and by "blew up" I mean "break down in front of" and asked why she thought I would be a good fit at business school because I truly and honestly couldn't see it for myself. Everyone thought it was a good idea but me, so I was just begging someone to help me see it. My mother's response? She didn't honestly think it was a great idea, but it was AN idea and I filled out the application so quickly she figured I must have somehow gotten excited by the idea of going back to school. It was then that I finally got angry. She said if I didn't want to do it, I needed to learn to say so. 

Ouch. And as is so often the case, it hurt because it was true. It was undoubtedly a wake-up call, and I've since been more aware of acquiescing simply to keep the peace or putting up with something because it's "easier" than dealing with the problem. What struck me most, however, was how it took me 3 days or so to articulate the feelings the conflict had stirred in me. I've grown up suppressing and delaying how I process those feelings for over 20 years, and it's a hard habit to break. The awareness at least is a start, and hopefully I can continue to get better.
