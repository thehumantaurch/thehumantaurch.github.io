			<h3>Early Life</h3>
			<p>Sarah was born in New Haven, Connnecticut in the wee hours of Holy Thursday in the year of 1986. She was a precocious thing at a young age and enjoyed school and reading a great deal. At age 3, she asked for her own laptop for Christmas. Her parents thought she was kidding. </div></td>

			<h3>The Aftermath</h3>

Since then she has scraped together money doing various odd jobs and acting. <b><em>Until now...</b></em>
