Week 6

Stereotype Threat
-----------------

So, let's say you're a socially conscious young white male. That's cool! Hi there, generic young white male, how are you today?

_Lucky bastard..._

Actually... that's really not fair of me. Because we've already decided you're socially conscious, right? You get #yesallwomen. You understand why we have [affirmative action](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/johncassidy/2013/06/why-america-still-needs-affirmative-action.html) in college applications and why it's important. You don't believe in discriminating against someone in hiring for their sexual orientation. I believe you, and let me tell you, sir, you are going to help make this world a better place for all of us. Seriously: thank you.

_There's just one problem..._

You will never know what it's like to have everything ever marketed to you in pink. You will never have to consider whether or not it's a good idea to put the hood in your sweatshirt up for fear of what conclusions people will draw about your appearance (see: [Trayvon Martin](http://www.rewireme.com/explorations/combating-stereotypes-in-the-classroom/#sthash.dF1IvZ8E.dpbs)). You get the idea.

Don't get me wrong, this is not your fault. You were born a white male. And in being socially conscious, you are probably doing your best to be considerate to everyone regardless of gender, race, and sexual orientation. But the opposite of stereotype threat is stereotype privilege, and that's something that's much harder to be aware of.

When I first applied to DevBootcamp, I talked in my application about how I was always interested and good with computers growing up, even from a young age. I asked for a laptop for Christmas at age 3 in 1989 when home computers were hardly widespread. Obviously, for many reasons, I did not find a laptop under the tree that year. But, if we fast forward 10 years, as a teenager I started learning HTML with friends for fun. While people told me I was good at it, no one actively encouraged me to pursue it. I was also really good at foreign languages and writing stories and papers. I enjoyed history. I was constantly encouraged to pursue these areas. This is what you, as a young, white, socially conscientious male probably didn't experience and will have a hard time appreciating. Again: not your fault.

I talked in my [week 4 blog](/cultural/culture/2014/06/29/week-4-cultural/) about women in tech and some of my experiences with stereotypes as a woman. There are plenty more where that came from, but instead I offer another story about how I've learned to be more aware of stereotype threat.

In January of 2013 I worked on a show with my friend, whom we'll call Louis. I saw him every day for three months. Louis was gay. Louis was also a huge nerd, and we talked about our love for anime and comics during our breaks and backstage. Nine months later, Louis came out as trans. This didn't surprise me in the slightest. Louis looked way better in high heeled boots than I ever did. A few months later when I finally got my first chance to hang out with Louis and a group of friends since his coming out, I made a <b>pronoun mistake</b>. Louis got angry. Louis told me he thought I knew better. I apologized and told him I did know better, but I had known him and worked with him for months as a man and it was force of habit.

Louis and I had a good discussion that day after the initial flare-up. I explained to him that I was not trying to be rude, and  While he understood it was an honest mistake, I had to learn that I acted without thinking. And while it was force of habit, I had to learn to be more conscientious until my habits changed. Louis learned that it was better to start a conversation than to get angry. If he hadn't said anything, I probably wouldn't even have noticed. That's the problem with privilege-- it's reinforced over the years of our lives, it creates habits, and we don't even realize we have stereotypes.

If we all make the decision to try to be conscientious of our privilege and stereotypes, we can change those habits that we pass down to our children. But we need to have an open dialogue. I hope that people in DBC will make me aware of my privilege if necessary, as Louis did, although I hope it can be a conversation rather than an accusation. I think that's key, and having the patience and presence of mind to wait until you cool down and away from others for privacy is also important. Habits won't change on the first or second reminder. It will take practice. But practice makes perfect :)
