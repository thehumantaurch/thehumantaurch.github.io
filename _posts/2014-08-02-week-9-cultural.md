To Ask, or Not To Ask
---------------------

You know who knew how to ask the big, tough questions? The ones that get right to the heart of the matter and don't mess around? Well, if the header was any indication, you know where I'm going with this: Hamlet, or rather, Master William Shakespeare. Okay, so maybe he wasn't exactly economical with his words (he WAS a poet after all), but "To be or not to be? That is the question." really cuts to the quick. This brings us to our first pro-tip:

**Asking Questions Tip # 1: Don't Mess Around**

Don't equivocate. Don't ramble on. Don't make excuses. You have every right to ask the question you're asking, and the person answering it doesn't need to know why you're asking. Remember to KISS: Keep It Simple Stupid. They just need the background situation and question, which brings us to our second pro-tip:

**Asking Questions Tip # 2: Know Your Audience**

If you're going to post on Stack Overflow, you have a wealth of amazing resources at your fingertips. The programmers on Stack Overflow are happy to help, but they're taking time out of their day to give you a hand. Don't make them ask you more questions in order to get to an answer for you (though sometimes this is unavoidable). Give them the relevant information such as what language you're working in, what programs you're working with and in, what you're trying to accomplish, and your best guess as to where things are going wrong. Don't just give them your code and say "help!" either. Asking a question is a conversation, not cheating on a test, which brings us to our final pro-tip:  

**Asking Questions Tip # 3: Don't Soliloquize**

Asking a question is the BEGINNING of a CONVERSATION. When you've answered questions before, what information did you need or use in order to find a solution? Make sure you provide it. Did anything ever frustrated you while you were trying to help someone? Make sure you don't do it. Follow up with people. Even if it turns out you made a stupid typo, if someone points it out, thank them. If they have a follow up question, answer it. If you have a follow up question, ask it. In other words: be courteous. 

In conclusion, I was lying in the beginning: don't actually emulate Hamlet. He was a lone wolf and he got killed in the end, so he's not really a great role model for this sort of thing. 

P.S. You know how frustrating it is when you can't get your code to work and it's all because of one tiny little comma you left out? For some people, it's just as frustrating to see commas left out of regular writing. Use them. Use proper spelling. Proofread. You may not care, but the person who may eventually solve your current headache may get a headache from your disdain of the oxford comma and not help you out. Food for thought :)
