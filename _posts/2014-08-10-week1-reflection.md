Week 1 Reflection
-----------------

+ When have you chosen not to expose your ignorance, and what impact did it have on your effectiveness?

The thing about working in the arts is that there is no such thing as a sure thing. I've become more and more comfortable with not knowing everything. I'm used to failure, too. I've adapted to the learning lifestyle. There's a pressure that comes with working people who are "stronger" than you, but it's a necessary evil. If they're worth working with, they'll help you. 

I find my biggest problem when I pretend I don't know something is the fear that comes along with it. When will it come out that I don't know? And most often there's also the fear of what the worst possible answer could be. Why I ever willingly put myself through that is a mystery because it feels awful. 

+ What are the 5 things you feel like you understand the least about computer programming? Try to keep it to stuff that you've tried to understand in the past.

1. Recursion(algorithms)
2. JavaScript
3. Attr_reader/writer/etc
4. Private vs. Public
5. Seeing things in an object oriented way as opposed to a functional way

+ What is the way you feel most comfortable exposing your ignorance?

I prefer to do it in the moment in person when it comes to material (if I think of the question), but it usually takes me some time to process something enough to form the question I need to ask. In those (more frequent) cases, the problem is whether or not I remember the question once I figure it out.
